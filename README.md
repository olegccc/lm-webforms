If you don't want to worry about any HTML markup but want to edit your existing model then this framework is for you.
Just define your model - fields and their types, and get Angular.Material-powered dialogs and web forms ready to edit your models.

It is easy to notice that examples contain only bootstrap HTML markup like script and CSS references.
